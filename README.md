# Sudoku

The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with the numbers 1-9 so that each column, row, and 3x3 sub-grid (or box) contains one of each digit. You may try out the game here: sudoku.com. Sudoku has 81 variables, i.e. 81 tiles. The variables are named by row and column, and are valued from 1 to 9 subject to the constraints that no two cells in the same row, column, or box may be the same.
